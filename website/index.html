		<h1>JinTn3270 is:</h1>
		<p>A library and framework for creating Telnet clients in Java. It
		implements Telnet (<a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc854.html">RFC 854</a>) and a set of extensivle Telnet Options.
		Currently this project is in a rapid state of development, and as
		such, is constantly changing. You can keep an eye on the latest
		developments by subscribing to the <a

		<h1>JinTn3270 is NOT:</h1>
		<p>Stable, Ready for Use, A 3270 Emulator, or the best thing since
		sliced bread.</p>
		
		<h1>History</h1>
		<p>After using <a
		href="http://freehost3270.sourceforge.net/">FreeHost3270</a> for more
		than a year, struggling to 
		build the type of components, interaction models, and dealing with
		cruft-based race conditions from a fragile and brain-dead threading
		model, I decided it was time to cure my problems. A clean break in
		API, clean separation of concerns (leading to a clean implementation)
		for telnet Option extensions, and application of MVC to the terminal
		buffer was essential. The pile of hap-hazzardly thrown-together telnet
		code and the nasty Tn3270Parser, as well as the brain-dead buffer
		handling made me decide that a Fork wasn't going to save FreeHost3270.
		It was time for a fresh start, synthesized from specs and practical
		experience.</p>
		<p>And thus, JinTn3270 was conceived.</p>
