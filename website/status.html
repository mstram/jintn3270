		<h1>Status:</h1>
		<p><b>6/29/2009</b> - Basic NVT support implemented! As a test case for interaction, the AWT Terminal component is nearly feature complete.
		In the very near future, a Swing component with mirrored (but somewhat superior) capability / performance will be introduced. The AWT terminal
		is more of a proof-of-concept than a long-term supported component. Since we already require Java 1.5, it's really not worth continuing to develop, and as such, will likely be eliminated very soon in favor of a proper Swing component. Nevertheless, this is a significant milestone.</p>
		
		<p>We are currently in the process of implementing a basic NVT device 
		in accordance with <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc854.html">
		RFC 854</a>. The controller (TelnetClient) is moving 
		along nicely. The model (Terminal) is just getting underway. As for 
		Views, there's a few options on the shelf, but there's nothing yet.</p>
		<p>The following Telnet Options have been implemented:
			<ul>
				<li>End Of Record - <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc885.html">RFC 885</a></li>
				<li>Suppress GA - <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc858.html">RFC 858</a></li>
			</ul>
