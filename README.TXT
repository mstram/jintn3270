JinTN3270
---------
JinTN3270 Is a 3270 Terminal emulator, written in 100% Java, licensed under 
the terms of the LGPL. JinTN3270 has been started as a fork of FreeHost3270,
due to an inability of contacting that projects admins, and a desire to break
both binary and source compatibility with the originating project.

Using FreeHost3270 as a starting point, JinTN3270 plans to completely 
restructure the API, network internals, and provide a responsive, flexible 
JTerminal Swing GUI component.

are welcome, as are critiques, code-reviews, and questions.
