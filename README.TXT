JinTN3270
---------
JinTN3270 Is a 3270 Terminal emulator, written in 100% Java, licensed under 
the terms of the OSI approved BSD license.

JinTN3270 is a clean-room implementation of RFCs 854, 1041, and 1576. Additional
information was gleaned from IBM Document Number GA23-0059-07, 3270 Information 
Display System Data Stream Programmer's Reference.

The GUI component (JTerminal) is an evolved version of the one I created for 
FreeHost3270, which for many reasons (both technical and practical) I have 
deemed unfit for general consumption, and desire to replace in my own projects.

And that's why JinTN3270 started. FreeHost3270 just couldn't cut it for me when 
it came to performance and stability.
