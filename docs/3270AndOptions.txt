This document is meant to outline some of the things I've learned as I implement
not just telnet, but also 327x emulation. First off, there is a massive
hodge-podge of ways to do this.

In the beginning:
	There was RFC 854 - Basic Telnet
	      
	      and RFC 856 - Binary Option 
		 and RFC 884 - Terminal Type Option 
		 and RFC 885 - End Of Record (EOR) Option

The combination of these three options applied over Telnet was apparently used
by many, many developers to determine support for 3270 data streams. From what I
have been able to glean from reading RFC 1647 (Tn3270e) if a terminal:
	* Requested BINARY mode, and
	* Requested EOR, and
	* Reported a terminal type "IBM-327x-x" then the remote host -should- start
	  sending the 3270 data stream within the BINARY stream.
It would then be up to the terminal to handle everything coming in from the
remote host between IACs (thanks to EOR) as 3270 data streams -- when in BINARY
mode.

Yikes! But no one knew -exactly- what was expected, so it was sort of a grab-bag
of what combinations would work and what wouldn't. In an attempt to document
this process, RFC 1041 - 3270 Regime Option, was introduced. Very few developers
actually implemented this option, from what I understand. What a shame.

Enter RFC 1647: A far more comprehensive, coheasive, and widely supported method
of sending 3270 data streams over telnet.

So now I have a quandry...

Do I implement 1647 AND 1041? What about not implementing 1041, and still
supporting 3270 data streams based on the combination of 856, 884, and 885?

This is quickly becoming a hodge-podge... There -has- to be a good solution to 
support all of this....


And that good solution is:
--------------------------
1.) To implement the various RFC's. All of them.
	* RFC 856 - Done. Sends incoming binary data to an OutputStream.
	* RFC 884 - Done. Sends subcommands. Not yet fully tested.
	* RFC 885 - Done. Working.
	* RFC 1041 - My testing environment does not support this Option. However a
	  I -think- the version in subversion will work. In theory, it should.
	  It encapsulated the Binary and EOR implementations that are described as
	  intristic to the implementation of this Option.
	* RFC 1576 - This should be working, if the above 3 RFCs are properly
	  implemented. The issue here is that the output stream of the Binary
	  Option will need to be parsed by a 3270 parser, same as 1041.
	* RFC 1647 - TN3270e is supported by my environment, and since it is not
	  only the newest option, but also the most structured, I plan on creating
	  a very solid implementation of this. RFC.
2.) Forward incoming Binary data to a 3270 parser that can also frame the
incoming streams of bytes. I plan to create an OutputStream that merely forwards
all written bytes to the print() methods of the TerminaModel class. This way,
specific terminalmodels can process the incoming byte stream as it arrives.

This should allow us to fully abstract the handling of 3270 data streams within
telnet data streams structured & negotiated in any of the three combinations of
entering 3270 mode.
